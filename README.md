## Overview

Well-**Form**ed Widget Fields — Well-Formed — is a collection of Flutter form
fields designed to keep your users' data well-formed, as well as to remove much
of the validation and form-related (boilerplate) code from your project.

In addition, this package improves the readability and maintainability of your
source code by providing a declarative, object-oriented interface.

## Getting Started

Most of the form fields in this package are built on top of a Flutter
`TextFormField` widget so that they remain fully compatible with Flutter's
`Form` widget container.

## Demo application

The demo application provides a fully working example, focused on demonstrating
exactly one field in action — CepField. You can take the code in this demo and
experiment with it.

To run the demo application:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dartoos-dev/well_formed.git
cd well_formed/example/
flutter run -d chrome

```

This should launch the demo application on Chrome in debug mode.
