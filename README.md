## Overview

Well-**Form**ed Widget Fields - Well-Formed - is a collection of Flutter form
fields widgets. This package aims to help developers to:

- keep user data (always) well-formed.
- reduce most of the (boilerplate) code related to form fields and their
  validations.
- improve readability and maintainability of source code by providing a
  declarative, object-oriented interface.

In order to be a reliable package, each class is well-documented and fully unit
tested by a CI/CD pipeline with rigorous quality gates.

## Getting Started

Most of the form fields in this package are built on top of a Flutter
`TextFormField` widget so that they remain fully compatible with Flutter's
`Form` widget container.

<!-- @todo #2 add a form field example as soon as possible -->

## Demo application

The demo application provides a fully working example, focused on demonstrating
exactly one field in action â€” CepField. You can take the code in this demo and
experiment with it.

To run the demo application:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dartoos-dev/well_formed.git
cd well_formed/example/
flutter run -d chrome
```

This should launch the demo application on Chrome in debug mode.
